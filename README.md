## Hi there 👋 I'm Aiman

🌐 Infrastructure Engineer | ☁️ Cloud Enthusiast | 🛠️ Automating the world, one script at a time

Hello there!
I’m an IT infrastructure engineer with a knack for keeping systems running smoothly and efficiently.
Fluent in multiple languages (both programming and human!), I can troubleshoot in Python, Java, and even Japanese.

Currently, I’m diving into the world of DevOps, where I’m learning to automate all the things.
When I’m not optimizing servers, you might find me optimizing my coffee intake. Fun fact: I once tried to debug my coffee machine… turns out it just needed more coffee!

Let’s 🔗 connect and build something amazing together!
